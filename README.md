# Elucida
- A mobile application for **medical emergency**.

### List of Nearby Hospitals
- The app shows a prioritized list of hospitals near the user, based on the user’s location.
  - The user can view information about the hospitals like *phone number, e-mail ID, website, pin-code, etc.* on pressing the marker of the hospital.

### Permanent Notification
- The user must enter his/her name, blood group, emergency contact’s name and phone number. 
  - These details will be displayed as a **permanent notification**. The notification is available even on the lock screen, which can be very useful when the user has met with an accident and his/her phone is locked and there are no emergency contacts to be found.

### Instant SMS
- An emergency button allows the users to directly send **SMS** to the emergency contact. 

### Near Field Communication
- We have also used **NFC tags** for storing emergency contact details and blood group of the user.
  - Now-a-days almost all the smartphones have NFC Readers. This will be helpful incase of any damage to the user's phone.
  - Anyone can read the NFC tag with the help of smartphone to obtain the emergency contact details and inform them.
